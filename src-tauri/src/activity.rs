//! Per-session activity signal, derived from pane output flow.
//!
//! This is the honest, CLI-agnostic foundation for "what is each agent doing
//! right now". The agent TUIs (Claude Code / Codex / Antigravity) stream output
//! continuously while they work — thinking spinners, token streaming, tool
//! output all produce bytes — and fall quiet when they finish a turn or wait for
//! input. So the presence of recent output is a robust proxy for "working", and
//! its absence for "idle/quiet", WITHOUT parsing any CLI-specific format.
//!
//! What this deliberately does NOT claim: it cannot tell *idle* apart from
//! *waiting-for-approval* apart from *done* (all three are simply "quiet"), and
//! it does not extract tokens / cost / turn counts — those live only inside each
//! CLI's own session and would need a per-CLI parser or the CLI's session files
//! (a separate effort; see BACKEND_PLAN.md). A TUI that animates while genuinely
//! idle could read as "working"; that is the known limit of an output-flow
//! signal and is preferred over fabricating a richer state we cannot observe.
